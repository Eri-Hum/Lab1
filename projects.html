                    <h3>Weather Dashboard with Python and JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>Created a weather dashboard using Python for backend API requests and JavaScript for frontend data visualization. The project fetched real-time weather data from an external API (OpenWeather) and displayed the results dynamically in the browser. CSS was used for styling a responsive layout, and JavaScript enabled features like city search and live updates. Python’s Flask framework handled the server-side logic, communicating weather data to the frontend. This project solidified knowledge in API handling and connecting Python with JavaScript for dynamic applications.</p>

                    <h3>To-Do List with Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>Built a functional to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Python for the backend API. The app allowed users to create, edit, and delete tasks, with all interactions stored locally using the localStorage API. The app featured a clean UI with modern CSS styling and animations for a smooth user experience. Python was used to implement a backend system for saving tasks remotely, with a RESTful API for task management. The project emphasized front-to-back integration, as well as JavaScript’s interaction with the DOM and browser storage.</p>
